Ray Di Felice

Ray most recently worked at Sifchain, a Cosmos-based DEX with spot margin trading, where he did a mix of research and product work. He proactively contributed to discussions about technical issues, combining his knowledge of crypto and market structure to inform colleagues what he thought were the best attributes in designing the product. He is experienced in communicating clearly with engineers, both verbally and through product documentation, writing ready-to-use Golang code able to be added to the codebase. Ray has also collaborated with the CEO, business development, and designers. He spoke directly with Sifchain on Discord to understand their needs and has attended conferences Ray can code in Python, Solidity, and Golang.

Prior to Sifchain, Ray was a market maker of currencies and precious metals at Barclays for 10 years, working in a high-consequence, often ambiguous environment where immediate results were demanded. Ray helped define the long-term vision and near-term priorities to grow several trading franchises and increase client activity and satisfaction. In that role he developed original trade ideas for distribution to salespeople and clients, also taking proprietary trading risk that aligned with those ideas to generate profits. Ray has a Masters in Financial Engineering from Cornell and a Bachelors in Mathematics and Finance from Rutgers.

Ray is passionate about blockchain technology and wants to contribute to its growth and adoption. From his work experience, he believes it is important to speak with stakeholders and potential users to understand their needs on a deeper level in order to build the right products to facilitate that growth.
